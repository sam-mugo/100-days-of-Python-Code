# Goal
> The goal of this Learning  track is to master as much Python as I can and be productive with it.

>To achieve the most, I won't strictly follow chapters laid out by books and crashcourses but rather attempt problems that will make me read ahead to get necessary knowledge required to solve the problem.

> The beginning of the next day of code should start with redoing the previous days' problems with all their different solutions on paper.
